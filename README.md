# wordpress-setup
Simple script for a quick'n dirty wordpress setup;
- creates a *.conf file for an apache virtual server; u still have to put it to the right place and reload apache ( systemctl reload apache2 )
- assumes the Database is already set with dbname and dbpass and subdomain being the same string ( remember to change that!!)
- requires wp-cli
